# python_base_game-v2
This is a basic game in python which I am designing to be easily expanded.  
It will utilise tiles to make up the game.

# Aditional knowlege:
While this basic game is a work in progress it's easier to use if the user has knowlege of python.

# Required modules:
Below is the current list of the required modules that you'll need to install via pip:  
1. pygame
<br>

Below is the inbuilt modules that pygame should already have:  
1. OS  
2. sys
